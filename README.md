### connect_pi.sh 
    Shell Script to manage Wi-Fi connection
    - Takes in the coordinates as two arguments 
    - Wi-Fi ESSID hardcoded

### send_data.py
    Python Script for sending out the Data
    - Takes x_coordinate,y_coordinate and an Int as an argument
    - Int decides where to send out the data [ Server (1) / Router (2)]
    - Computes the MAC of the data and sends it along

### broker_pi.py
    Python Script for the broker Pi
    - Listens on a specific MQTT channel
    - Computes MAC, checks it against the data
    - Stores the data from three Rpis on log.json
    - After receiving data from three Rpis, AGGREGATES DATA
        - computes average of temperature, pressure, humidity
    - Sends it off to the server on a different channel
    - Truncates log.json, resets counter

### geo.py
    Python Script fot the Server [AWS]
    - Listens to feed on two MQTT channels
        - For data directly sent to the server from non-router Pis
        - For aggregated data sent from router Pis
    - Checks for data integrity by computing the MAC and verifying against sent MAC
    - Stores the data in protei.geojson or neighborhoods.geojson according to where the data is received from

### geojs.html
    HTML file for plotting GeoJSON data using Leaflet
    - Displays data from 'protei.geojson' as Markers
    - Displays data from 'neighborhoods.geojson' as Polygon (Choropleth Map)
    - leaflet.markercluster.js, MarkerCluster.css for aesthetics
